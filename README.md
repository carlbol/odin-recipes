# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to make linked pages (that will feature recipes) using all the html elements that I have learned about so far. I shall demonstrate:
-My ability to use headings (h1, h2...), 
-emphasizers (strong, em), 
-lists (ul, ol, li), 
-links -both external and internal- (a), 
-and images (img)
